# Mintlify Documentation Website Clone

A desktop-first documentation-style website inspired by the Mintlify landing page.

This project recreates the structure, layout, and visual hierarchy of the original Mintlify documentation site using only HTML and CSS.

## 🧱 Technical Constraints Followed

* HTML + CSS only
* No JavaScript
* No TailwindCSS
* Desktop-only layout
* No animations or interactive effects
* Container-based layout system
* Flexbox and CSS Grid for structure

---

## 🎨 Fonts Used

**Inter (Google Fonts)**
Weights used:

* 400 (Regular)
* 500 (Medium)
* 600 (Semi-bold)
* 700 (Bold)

Reason:
Inter closely matches Mintlify’s clean, modern sans-serif typography and improves readability.

If you'd like, I can also generate:

* A screenshot-ready version with markdown image embeds
* Or a GitHub-friendly structure version with badges and deployment instructions
